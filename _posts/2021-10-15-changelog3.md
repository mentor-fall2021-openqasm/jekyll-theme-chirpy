# Meeting notes

- Openpulse backend support access if needed - Junye
- Cleanup minor details for implementation for the current progress.
- Charge forward to defcal!
- Seeking guidance if anyone has written openpulse grammars.
- Pluggable grammars: need to decide on which grammar to select and checkout if anyone has a sample grammer set.
- Look into implement physical qubit syntax and part of duration syntax.
- Openended questions may mean the grammar isnt even complete https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/language/openpulse.html.
- Jack will check out with TSC if its possible to get a copy of openpulse grammar.
- May have to invent our own defcal grammar.
