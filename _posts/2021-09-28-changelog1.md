## Update notes
- **Added** Initial implementation for types.py
- Update log  <br />
>  1.  **source/openqasm/src/openqasm/translator/context.py -**  
        * Span now optional
        *   Context can now use the AssignmentOperator to assign value to previously declared symbol
        *   Added support to store types
>  2.  **source/openqasm/src/openqasm/translator/translator.py -**
        *  Updated quantum_gate definition
        *  Updated PhaseGate definition
        *  Added ForInLoop support. Added_get_range method with exception handling for wrong RangeDefinition
        *  Added support for branching from context
        *  Added_process_QuantumMeasurementAssignment for processing quantum measurement assignment as per AST
        *  Improved file parsing routine
        -  Added support to process ClassicalAssignment and QuantumBarrier
        -  Quantum gate definitions now support names.
        -  include_dirs, program_ast and includes_asts attributes now private
>  3.  **source/openqasm/src/openqasm/translator/test.py -** Added basic testing functionality for types UnsignedIntegerType, BitArrayType, SignedIntegerType, AngleType, ClassicalType using pytest
>  4.  **source/openqasm/src/openqasm/translator/identifiers.py -**
        -  Updated get_identifier return type. All identifier types now have a common interface.
>  5.  **source/openqasm/src/openqasm/translator/expressions.py -** 
        -   Expression evaluation now has its own function dict instead of eval calls
        -   Added constants : Tau, euler
        -   Added support for AssignmentOperator
>  6.  **source/openqasm/src/openqasm/translator/exceptions.py -** 
        -  Added WrongRange exception when mandatory range values are missing
        -  Added InvalidIncludePath exception when file specified is not present in any of the include paths. Also provides info on include paths if applicable.
        -  Added ClassicalOverFlow exception when there is an integer overflow
        -  Added InvalidOperation exception when given operator is not implemented for a given type with support for SignedIntegertypes
        -  Added InvalidTypeAssignment when wrong types of operands are evaluated
>  7.  **source/openqasm/src/openqasm/translator/types.py -** Initial implementation  for types.py
        -  Added "working" implementation of UnsignedInteger and BitArrayType
        -  Added "working" support for SignedIntegerType
        -  Added BitArray and Angle support
>  8.  **source/openqasm/src/openqasm/build_ast.py - **
        -  Update file parsing and input argument specification
        -  Added --help args and --translate flag
        -  Now uses stdlib argparse to parse cli arguments  
> 9.  **Merged aspcompiler:master into refimpl**  
      **- Notable changes:** index set can now be specified by a signed or unsigned integer
